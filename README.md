# Modeling spatial intercellular communication and multilayer signaling regulations using stMLnet

## Introduction
Multicellular organisms require intercellular and intracellular signaling to coordinately regulate different cell functions. The technological advance of spatial transcriptomics (ST) lets us leverage spatial information to better elucidate cell signaling and functioning. 

We propose an ST-based multilayer network method, stMLnet, for inferring spatial intercellular communication and multilayer signaling regulations by quantifying distance-weighted ligandâ€“receptor signaling activity based on diffusion and mass action models and mapping it to intracellular targets. To benchmark stMLnet, we designed a benchmark framework to evaluate and compare its performance with other representative CCC inference methods for inferring intercellular and intracellular communication. We compared stMLnet with six state-of-the-art CCC inference methods, including CellChatV2, COMMOT, CytoTalk, MISTy, NicheNet, and Scriabin. We evaluated these seven methods using three ST datasets and used 15 sets of cell line perturbed expression data as the ground truth to assess the prediction results. 

Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of stMLnet on six ST datasets acquired with four different technologies (e.g., seqFISH+, Slide-seq v2, MERFISH, Stereo-seq, and Visium), showing its effectiveness and reliability on ST data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, stMLnet identifies positive feedback circuits between alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes via multilayer signaling pathways within a COVID-19 microenvironment. Our proposed method provides an effective tool for predicting multilayer signaling regulations between interacting cells, which can advance the mechanistic and functional understanding of spatial CCCs.

The R package of stMLnet is publicly available from <a href="https://github.com/SunXQlab/stMLnet" target="_blank">stMLnet repository</a>.
